👋 Hi, I'm Ealanisln, a web developer passionate about creating impactful and dynamic experiences on the web. Originally from Mexico City, raised in León, México, and now proud to call the SF Bay Area my home.

🌟 I began my journey in tech support, and I am now embarking on an exciting new chapter in the development field.

👨🏽‍💻 Currently, my focus lies on mastering React, Next.js, and NodeJS, as I strive to stay at the forefront of modern web development practices. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge.

🔥 One of the tools I enjoy working with is Supabase, a powerful open-source alternative to Firebase. I find immense satisfaction in collaborating on challenging projects that push my boundaries and allow me to continuously learn and grow.
